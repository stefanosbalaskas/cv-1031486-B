display-style: line # The style for the top of the page. This can be any memoir chapter style as demonstrated in 10.5 of the Memoir manual: http://texdoc.net/texmf-dist/doc/latex/memoir/memman.pdf. Reasonable values include: bianchi, bringhurst, chappell, crosshead, demo2, dowding, lyhne, and wilsondob. Some of these styles will clobber your font choices. “line” is a style I created based on the res.cls line option.
